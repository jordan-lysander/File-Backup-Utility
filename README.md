# File Backup Utility

A simple Python script to copy files from one directory to another. Includes a CLI menu but can also be run directly from CL using the source and destination directory as positional arguments.

## How It's Made

It was made using Python and its standard libraries. There was a lot of trial and error since it was my first real completed project.

## Why I Made It

This program's purpose is mainly as practice for a larger project I wanted to create - an **automatic directory organiser**. This was a lot of fun to program and I learned a great deal about Python libraries I had never used before: shutil, pathlib, argparse.

## Things I Learned

This was also my first *real* commitment to GitHub, since I wanted to make sure I was committing to repositories more often and whenever it made sense. So I made an effort to commit every time there was a significant change to the program - refactoring code, adding a logging system, implementing new features, etc.

## Closing

For a first finished project I am incredibly proud of it. I recognise it's rather simple but it was a necessary step for me in my programming journey.
